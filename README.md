Project Overview  
This project is an **Airbnb Clone** that I am building as part of my learning journey in software engineering. The goal is to recreate the core features of Airbnb, such as user authentication, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.  

By working on this project, I aim to strengthen my full-stack development skills and gain hands-on experience with real-world tools and workflows. It’s not just about coding, but also about learning how to design databases, build secure APIs, and understand the complete process of software development — from writing code to deploying an application.  

This project is also helping me get comfortable with teamwork concepts, GitHub collaboration, and industry best practices that are essential for professional software engineers.
