Project Overview  
This project is an **Airbnb Clone** that I am building as part of my learning journey in software engineering. The goal is to recreate the core features of Airbnb, such as user authentication, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.  

By working on this project, I aim to strengthen my full-stack development skills and gain hands-on experience with real-world tools and workflows. It’s not just about coding, but also about learning how to design databases, build secure APIs, and understand the complete process of software development — from writing code to deploying an application.  

This project is also helping me get comfortable with teamwork concepts, GitHub collaboration, and industry best practices that are essential for professional software engineers. 

Team Roles  

For this Airbnb Clone project, different roles are important to ensure the application is well-structured, secure, and user-friendly. Each role has a unique responsibility, and together they form the backbone of a successful software project.  

1. Backend Developer  
Responsible for building the **logic and functionality** of the app. This includes designing APIs, handling data requests, managing user authentication, and making sure the system runs smoothly behind the scenes.  

2. Frontend Developer  
Focuses on the **user interface (UI)** and user experience. They ensure that the design is responsive, clean, and intuitive so users can easily browse properties, make bookings, and interact with the platform.  

3. Database Administrator (DBA)  
Takes care of the **database design, management, and performance**. They make sure that data (users, bookings, payments, etc.) is stored securely, relationships are well-defined, and queries run efficiently.  

4. DevOps Engineer  
Manages the **CI/CD pipeline, deployment, and server infrastructure**. Their role is to automate builds, testing, and deployments using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker, ensuring the app is reliable and scalable.  

5. QA Engineer (Tester)  
Ensures the app is **bug-free and stable** by writing test cases, running tests, and verifying features. They focus on quality control so users have a smooth experience.  

6. Project Manager  
Coordinates the project, making sure deadlines are met and that team members collaborate effectively. They track progress, communicate goals, and keep the project aligned with its objectives.
